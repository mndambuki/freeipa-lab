= FreeIPA

Deploy a FreeIPA cluster using Ansible.

== Requirements

- Libvirt 5.6.0+
- Terraform 0.12.25+
- Libvirt provider for Terraform 0.6.2+
- Ansible 2.9.9+

Install requirements.

```bash
make requirements
```

== Setup Libvirt

Use `virsh` command utility to configure libvirt.

```bash
export LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI="qemu:///system"
```

Check if libvirt is running.

```bash
virsh version --daemon
```

=== QEMU permissions

The provider does not currently support to create volumes with different mode than `root:root` so QEMU agent must run as priviledged. Set user and password in `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` file.

```bash
...
user = "root"
group = "root"
...
```

Restart libvirt daemon.

```bash
systemctl restart libvirtd
```

== Troubleshooting

Enable debug mode by setting `TF_VAR_DEBUG` to `true` before planning terraform changes.

```bash
export TF_VAR_DEBUG="true"
```
